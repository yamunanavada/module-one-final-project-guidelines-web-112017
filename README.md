Purpose

*This program allows users to get real-time data on available flights.*

  1. Users can make a real-time query to see flights that match user-provided parameters of origin, destination, and
      departure date (“Search”) OR origin, departure date, and budget (“Inspire Me”)
  2. Users can save a flight to their account, as a “Trip”
  3. User can view all of their saved Trips
  4. User can “book” a given Trip (proxy feature only - no real bookings are made)

*To launch the program*

1. In Terminal, navigate to the directory where program was saved; program is named module-one-final-project-guidelines-web-112017
2. Run bundle install followed by bundle update
3. Run ruby bin/run.rb, and follow the instructions on the screen.

Note the program relies on two APIs available at https://sandbox.amadeus.com/api-catalog - “Flight Extensive Search”, and “Flight Inspiration Search”
